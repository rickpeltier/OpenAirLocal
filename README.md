# OpenAirLocal
Source Code for Shiny-based version of OAL

Code in development for a shiny-based web app that allows a more advanced user to a) select a pollutant and location, b) choose a timeframe of interest, and c) call R-functions that fetch air quality data (by API to OpenAQ) and meteorology data (by API to NOAA), d) merge it together, and e) provide graphical output.  The code also allows a user to download the specific dataframe they have chosen, as well as the graphical output as a PDF.
